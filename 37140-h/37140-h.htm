<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot"><i>The scene is laid in a fashionable New York drawing-room. The
time is late in October, and Wednesday afternoon. The curtain
rising shows an empty room. A bell rings. After a pause the
front-door is heard opening and closing. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>through
portière at rear of room</i>.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Ah! So far so good; but I wish it were over. I've had the
nerve to get as far as the house and into it, but how much further my
courage will carry me I can't say. Confound it! Why is it, I wonder,
that men get so rattled when they're head over heels in love, and want
to ask the fair object of their affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> to wed? I can't see. Now I'm
brave enough among men. I'm not afraid of anything that walks, except
Dorothy Andrews, and generally I'm not afraid of her. Stopping runaway
teams and talking back to impudent policemen have been my delight. I've
even been courageous enough to submit a poem in person to the editor of
a comic weekly, and yet here this afternoon I'm all of a tremble. And
for what reason? Just because I've co-come to ask Dorothy Andrews to
change her name to Mrs. Bob Yardsley; as if that were such an unlikely
thing for her to do. Gad! I'm almost inclined to despise myself.
(<i>Surveys himself in the mirror at one end of the room. Then walking up
to it and peering intently at his reflection, he continues.</i>) Bah! you
coward! Afraid of a woman&mdash;a sweet little woman like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> Dorothy. You ought
to be ashamed of yourself, Bob Yardsley. <i>She</i> won't hurt you. Brace up
and propose like a man&mdash;like a real lover who'd go through fire for her
sake, and all that. Ha! That's easy enough to talk about, but how shall
I put it? That's the question. Let me see. How <i>do</i> men do it? I ought
to buy a few good novels and select the sort of proposal I like; but not
having a novel at hand, I must invent my own. How will it be? Something
like this, I fancy. (<i>The portières are parted, and</i> <span class="smcap">Jennie</span>, <i>the maid,
enters</i>. <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>does not observe her entrance</i>.) I'll get down on my
knees. A man on his knees is a pitiable object, and pity, they say, is
akin to love. Maybe she'll pity me, and after that&mdash;well, perhaps pity's
cousin will arrive. (<i>The maid advances, but</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>is so intent
upon</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> <i>his proposal that he still fails to observe her. She stands back
of the sofa, while he, gazing downward, kneels before it.</i>) I'll say:
"Divine creature! At last we are alone, and I&mdash;ah&mdash;I can speak freely
the words that have been in my heart to say to you for so long&mdash;oh, so
long a time." (<span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>appears surprised</i>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> "I have never even hinted
at how I feel towards you. I have concealed my love, fearing lest by too
sudden a betrayal of my feelings I should lose all." (<i>Aside.</i>) Now for
a little allusion to the poets. Poetry, they say, is a great thing for
proposals. "You know, dearest, you must know, how the poet has phrased
it&mdash;'Fain would I fall but that I fear to climb.' But now&mdash;now I must
speak. An opportunity like this may not occur again. Will you&mdash;will you
be my wife?"</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>gives a little scream of delight</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_001.png" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">"'DIVINE CREATURE'"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Oh, Mr. Yardsley, this is so suddent like and unexpected, and
me so far beneath you!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>
<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>looks up and is covered with confusion</i>.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Great Scott! What have I done?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> But of course it ain't for the likes of me to say no to&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>rising</i>). For Heaven's sake, Jennie&mdash;do be
sensi&mdash;Don't&mdash;say&mdash;Jennie, why&mdash;ah&mdash; (<i>Aside.</i>) Oh, confound it! What the deuce
shall I say? What's the matter with my tongue? Where's my vocabulary? A
word! a word! my kingdom for a word! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Now, Jen&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> (<i>coyly</i>). I has been engaged to Mr. Hicks, the coach
gentleman, sir, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Good! good! I congratulate you, Jennie. Hicks is a very fine
fellow. Drives like a&mdash;like a driver, Jennie, a born driver. I've seen
him many a time sitting like a king on his box&mdash;yes, indeed. Noticed him
often. Admired him. Gad, Jennie, I'll see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> him myself and tell him; and
what is more, Jennie, I'll&mdash;I'll give Hicks a fine present.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Yes, sir; I has no doubt as how you'll be doin' the square
thing by Hicks, for, as I was a-sayin', I has been engaged like to him,
an' he has some rights; but I think as how, if I puts it to him right
like, and tells him what a nice gentleman you are (<i>a ring is heard at
the front-door</i>), it'll be all right, sir. But there goes the bell and I
must run, Mr. Yardsley. (<i>Ecstatically kissing her hand.</i>) Bob!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a convulsive gasp</i>). Bob? Jennie! You&mdash;er&mdash;you
misun&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Jennie</span>, <i>with a smile of joy and an ecstatic glance at</i>
<span class="smcap">Yardsley</span>, <i>dances from the room to attend the door.</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>throws
himself into a chair</i>.) Well, I'll be teetotally&mdash;Awh! It's too dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
easy proposing to somebody you don't know you are proposing to. What a
kettle of fish this is, to be sure! Oh, pshaw! that woman can't be
serious. She must know I didn't mean it for her. But if she doesn't,
good Lord! what becomes of me? (<i>Rises, and paces up and down the room
nervously. After a moment he pauses before the glass.</i>) I ought to be
considerably dishevelled by this. I feel as if I'd been drawn through a
knot-hole&mdash;or&mdash;or dropped into a stone-crusher&mdash;that's it, a
stone-crusher&mdash;a ten-million horse-power stone-crusher. Let's see how
you look, you poor idiot.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>As he is stroking his hair and rearranging his tie he talks in
pantomime at himself in the glass. In a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>ushers</i>
<span class="smcap">Mr. Jack Barlow</span> <i>into the room</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Miss Andrews will be down in a minute, sir.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>takes arm-chair and sits gazing ahead of him. Neither he
nor</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>perceives the other</i>. <span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>tiptoes to one side,
and, tossing a kiss at</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span>, <i>retires</i>.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Now for it. I shall leave this house to-day the happiest or
the most miserable man in creation, and I rather think the odds are in
my favor. Why shouldn't they be? Egad! I can very well understand how a
woman could admire me. I admire myself, rather. I confess candidly that
I do not consider myself half bad, and Dorothy has always seemed to feel
that way herself. In fact, the other night in the Perkinses'
conservatory she seemed to be quite ready for a proposal. I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> have done
it then and there if it hadn't been for that confounded Bob Yardsley&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>turning sharply about</i>). Eh? Somebody spoke my name. A man,
too. Great Heavens! I hope Jennie's friend Hicks isn't here. I don't
want to have a scene with Hicks. (<i>Discovering</i> <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>.)
Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;why&mdash;hullo, Barlow! You here?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>impatiently, aside</i>). Hang it! Yardsley's here too! The man's
always turning up when he's not wanted. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Ah! why, Bob, how are
you? What're you doing here?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> What do you suppose&mdash;tuning the piano? I'm here because I
want to be. And you?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> For the same reason that you are.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside</i>). Gad! I hope not.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> (<i>Aloud.</i>) Indeed? The great
mind act again? Run in the same channel, and all that? Glad to see you.
(<i>Aside.</i>) May the saints forgive me that fib! But this fellow must be
got rid of.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>embarrassed</i>). So'm I. Always glad to see myself&mdash;I mean
you&mdash;anywhere. Won't you sit down?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Thanks. Very kind of you, I'm sure. (<i>Aside.</i>) He seems very
much at home. Won't I sit down?&mdash;as if he'd inherited the chairs! Humph!
I'll show him.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> What say?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I&mdash;ah&mdash;oh, I was merely remarking that I thought it was
rather pleasant out to-day.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Yes, almost too fine to be shut up in-doors. Why aren't you
driving, or&mdash;or playing golf, or&mdash;ah&mdash;or being out-doors somewhere? You
need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> exercise, old man; you look a little pale. (<i>Aside.</i>) I must get
him away from here somehow. Deuced awkward having another fellow about
when you mean to propose to a woman.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Oh, I'm well enough!</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/fig_002.png" alt="" /><p class="caption">"I'LL TIME YOU"</p></div>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>solicitously</i>). You don't look it&mdash;by Jove, you don't.
(<i>Suddenly inspired.</i>) No, you don't, Bob. You overestimate your
strength. It's very wrong to overestimate one's strength.
People&mdash;ah&mdash;people have died of it. Why, I'll bet you a hat you can't
start now and walk up to Central Park and back in an hour. Come. I'll
time you. (<i>Rises and takes out watch.</i>) It is now four-ten. I'll wager
you can't get back here before five-thirty. Eh? Let me get your hat.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Starts for door.</i></p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a laugh</i>). Oh no; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> don't bet&mdash;after four. But I say,
did you see Billie Wilkins?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>returning in despair</i>). Nope.</p>




<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside</i>). Now for a bit of strategy. (<i>Aloud.</i>) He was
looking for you at the club. (<i>Aside.</i>) Splendid lie! (<i>Aloud.</i>) Had
seats for the&mdash;ah&mdash;the Metropolitan to-night. Said he was looking for
you. Wants you to go with him. (<i>Aside.</i>) That ought to start him along.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I'll go with him.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Well, you'd bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>ter let him know at once, then.
Better run around there and catch him while there's time. He said if he
didn't see you before half-past four he'd get Tom Parker to go. Fine
show to-night. Wouldn't lose the opportunity if I were you. (<i>Looking at
his watch.</i>) You'll just about have time to do it now if you start at
once.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Grasps</i> <span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>by arm, and tries to force him out</i>. <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>
<i>holds back, and is about to remonstrate, when</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>enters.
Both men rush to greet her</i>; <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>catches her left hand</i>,
<span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>her right</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>slightly embarrassed</i>). Why, how do you do&mdash;this is an
unexpected pleasure&mdash;both of you? Excuse my left hand, Mr. Yardsley; I
should have given you the other if&mdash;if you'd given me time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Don't mention it, I pray. The unexpectedness is wholly mine,
Miss Andrews&mdash;I mean&mdash;ah&mdash;the pleasure is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Wholly mine.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>withdrawing her hands from both and sitting down</i>). I
haven't seen either of you since the Perkinses' dance. Wasn't it a
charming affair?</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/fig_003.png" alt="" /><p class="caption">"START AT ONCE"</p></div>


<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Delightful I&mdash;ah&mdash;I didn't know that the Perkinses&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). It was a good deal of a crush, though. As
Mrs. Van Darling said to me, "You always meet&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> It's a pity Perkins isn't more of a society man, though,
don't you think?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Oh, I don't know. I've always found him very pleasant. He is
so sincere.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Isn't he, though? He looked bored to death all through the
dance.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I thought so too. I was watching him while you were talking
to him, Barlow, and such a look of ennui I never saw on a man's face.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Humph!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Are you going to Mrs. Van Darling's dinner?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Yes; I received my bid last night. You?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Oh yes!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). I can't go very well. I'm&mdash;ah&mdash;engaged for
Tuesday.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Well, I hope you've let Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> Van Darling know. She's a
stickler for promptness in accepting or declining her invitations. If
you haven't, I'll tell her for you. I'm to see her to-night.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Oh no! Never mind. I'll&mdash;I'll attend to it.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Oh, of course. But it's just as well she should know in
advance. You might forget it, you know. I'll tell her; it's no trouble
to me.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Of course not, and she can get some one to take your place.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Oh, don't say anything about it. Fact is,
she&mdash;ah&mdash;she hasn't invited me.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Ah! (<i>Aside.</i>) I knew that all along. Oh, but I'm clever!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>hastily, to relieve</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley's</span> <i>embarrassment</i>). Have you
seen Irving, Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>suspiciously</i>). What in? I haven't seen you at any of the
first nights.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a grin</i>). In the grill-room at the Players'.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>aside</i>). Bah!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>laughing</i>). You are so bright, Mr. Yardsley.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>forcing a laugh</i>). Ha, ha, ha! Why, yes&mdash;very clever that. It
ought to have a Gibson picture over it, that joke. It would help it.
Those Gibson pictures are fine, I think. Carry any kind of joke, eh?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Yes, they frequently do.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I'm so glad you both like Gibson, for I just dote on him. I
have one of his originals in my portfolio. I'll get it if you'd like to
see it.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>She rises and goes to the corner of the room, where there
stands a portfolio-case.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside</i>). What a bore Barlow is! Hang him! I must get rid of
him somehow.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>meanwhile is assisting</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>looking around at the others</i>). Jove! he's off in the
corner with her. Can't allow that, for the fact is Barlow's just a bit
dangerous&mdash;to me.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>rummaging through portfolio</i>). Why, it <i>was</i> here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Maybe it's in this other portfolio.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>joining them</i>). Yes, maybe it is. That's a good idea. If it
isn't in one portfolio maybe it's in another. Clever thought! I may be
bright, Miss Andrews, but you must have observed that Barlow is
thoughtful.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>with a glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>). Yes, Mr. Yardsley, I have noticed
the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span><i>Barlow.</i> Tee-hee! that's one on you, Bob.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>obtuse</i>). Ha, ha! Yes. Why, of course! Ha, ha, ha! For
repartee I have always said&mdash;polite repartee, of course&mdash;Miss Andrews
is&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) Now what the dickens did she mean by that?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I can't find it here. Let&mdash;me think. Where&mdash;can&mdash;it&mdash;be?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>striking thoughtful attitude</i>). Yes, where can it be? Let me
do your thinking for you, Miss Dorothy. (<i>Then softly to her.</i>) Always!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>mocking</i> <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>). Yes! Let <i>me</i> think! (<i>Points his finger
at his forehead and assumes tragic attitude. Then stalks to the front of
stage in manner of burlesque Hamlet.</i>) Come, thought, come. Shed the
glory of thy greatness full on me, and thus confound mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> enemies.
Where the deuce is that Gibson?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Oh, I remember. It's upstairs. I took it up with me last
night. I'll ring for Jennie, and have her get it.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside, and in consternation</i>). Jennie! Oh, thunder! I'd

<p><i>Barlow.</i> What say?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Nothing; only&mdash;ah&mdash;only that I thought it was very&mdash;very
pleasant out.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> That's what you said before.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Well, what of it? It's the truth. If you
don't believe it, go outside and see for yourself.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>appears at the door in response to</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy's</span> <i>ring</i>.

that belongs in the stand over there.</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> (<i>dazed</i>). Yessum. And shall I be bringin' lemons with it?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Lemons, Jennie?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> You always does have lemons with your tea, mum.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I didn't mention tea. I want you to get my portfolio from
upstairs. It is on the table in the corner of my room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>noting the glance, presumably aside</i>). Confound that
Jennie!</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>overhearing</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span>). What's that? Confound that Jennie?
Why say confound that Jennie? Why do you wish Jennie to be confounded?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>nervously</i>). I didn't say that. I&mdash;ah&mdash;I merely said
that&mdash;that Jennie appeared to be&mdash;ah&mdash;confounded.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> She certainly is confused. I cannot understand it at all.
Ordinarily I have rather envied Jennie her composure.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Oh, I suppose&mdash;it's&mdash;it's&mdash;it's natural for a young girl&mdash;a
servant&mdash;sometimes to lose her&mdash;equipoise, as it were, on occasions. If
we lose ours at times, why not Jennie? Eh? Huh?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Certainly.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Of course&mdash;ha&mdash;trained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> servants are hard to get these days,
anyhow. Educated people&mdash;ah&mdash;go into other professions, such as law,
and&mdash;ah&mdash;the ministry&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Well, never mind. Let's talk of something more interesting
than Jennie. Going to the Chrysanthemum Show, Mr. Barlow?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I am; wouldn't miss it for the world. Do you know, really now,
the chrysanthemum, in my opinion, is the most human-looking flower we
have. The rose is too beautiful, too perfect, for me. The chrysanthemum,
on the other hand&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). Looks so like a football-player's head it
appeals to your sympathies? Well, perhaps you are right. I never thought
of it in that light before, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Nor I; but now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> that you mention it, it does look
that way, doesn't it?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>not wishing to disagree with</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>). Very much. Droll
idea, though. Just like Bob, eh? Very, very droll. Bob's always dro&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>interrupting</i>). When I see a man walking down the avenue
with a chrysanthemum in his button-hole, I always think of a wild Indian
wearing a scalp for decorative purposes.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>relieved, and thankful for the suggestion</i>). Why, how did

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Ho! Is the world nothing but lint to you? Of course not&mdash;the

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>holding the picture up</i>). Fine. Just look at that girl.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><i>Barlow.</i> Very.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_004.png" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">"CHARMING, ISN'T IT?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>looking over</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy's</span> <i>other shoulder</i>). Yes, very
pretty, and lots of style. (<i>Softly.</i>) Very&mdash;like some one&mdash;some one I
know.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>overhearing</i>). I think so my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>self, Yardsley. It's exactly
like Josie Wilkins. By-the-way&mdash;ah&mdash;how is that little affair coming
along, Bob?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>interested</i>). What! You don't mean to say&mdash;Why, <i>Mister</i>
Yardsley!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a venomous glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>). Nonsense. Nothing in
it. Mere invention of Barlow's. He's a regular Edison in his own way.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>looks inquiringly at</i> <span class="smcap">Barlow</span>.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span>). Oh, don't be so sly about it, old fellow!
<i>Every</i>body knows.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> But I tell you there's nothing in it. I&mdash;I have different
ideas entirely, and you&mdash;you know it&mdash;or, if you don't, you will
shortly.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Oh! Then it's some one else, Mr. Yardsley? Well, now I <i>am</i>
interested. Let's have a little confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> talk together. Tell <i>us</i>,
Mr. Yardsley, tell Mr. Barlow and me, and maybe&mdash;I can't say for
certain, of course&mdash;but maybe we can help you.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>gleefully rubbing his hands</i>). Yes, old man; certainly. Maybe
we&mdash;<i>we</i> can help you.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>desperately</i>). You can help me, both of you&mdash;but&mdash;but I
can't very well tell you how.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I'm willing to do all I can for you, my dear Bob. If you will
only tell us her name I'll even go so far as to call, in your behalf,
and propose for you.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Oh, thanks. You are very kind.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I think so too, Mr. Barlow. You are almost too kind, it seems
to me.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Oh no; not too kind, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> Andrews. Barlow simply realizes
that one who has proposed marriage to young girls as frequently as he
has knows how the thing is done, and he wishes to give me the benefit of
his experience. (<i>Aside.</i>) That's a facer for Barlow.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Ha, ha, ha! Another joke, I suppose. You see, my dear Bob,
that I am duly appreciative. I laugh. Ha, ha, ha! But I must say I laugh
with some uncertainty. I don't know whether you intended that for a joke
or for a staggerer. You should provide your conversation with a series
of printed instructions for the listener. Get a lot of cards, and have
printed on one, "Please laugh"; on another, "Please stagger"; on
another, "Kindly appear confused." Then when you mean to be jocose hand
over the laughter card, and so on. Shall I stagger?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><i>Dorothy.</i> I think that Mr. Yardsley meant that for a joke. Didn't you,
Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Why, certainly. Of course. I don't really believe Barlow
ever had sand enough to propose to any one. Did you, Jack?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>indignant</i>). Well, I rather think I have.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Ho, ho! Then you <i>are</i> an experienced proposer, Mr. Barlow?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>confused</i>). Why&mdash;er&mdash;well&mdash;um&mdash;I didn't exactly mean that,
you know. I meant that&mdash;ah&mdash;if it ever came to the&mdash;er&mdash;the test, I
think I could&mdash;I'd have sand enough, as Yardsley puts it, to do the
thing properly, and without making a&mdash;ah&mdash;a Yardsley of myself.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>bristling up</i>). Now what do you mean by that?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I think you are both of you horrid this afternoon. You are so
quarrelsome. Do you two always quarrel, or is this merely a little
afternoon's diversion got up for my especial benefit?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>with dignity</i>). I never quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Nor I. I simply differ sometimes, that's all. I never had an
unpleasant word with Jack in my life. Did I, Jack?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Never. I always avoid a fracas, however great the provocation.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Then let us have a cup of tea together and be
more sociable. I have always noticed that tea promotes
sociability&mdash;haven't you, Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Always. (<i>Aside.</i>) Among women.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> What say?</p>

<p class="blockquot"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>[<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>rises and rings the bell for</i> <span class="smcap">Jennie</span>.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I say that I am very fond of tea.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> So am I&mdash;here.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Rises and looks at pictures.</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>meanwhile sits in moody

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>returning</i>). You seem to have something on your mind, Mr.

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I have something on my mind, Miss Dorothy. It's&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>coming forward</i>). Wise man, cold weather like this. It would
be terrible if you let your mind go out in cold weather without anything
on it. Might catch cold in your idea.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I wonder why Jennie doesn't come? I shall have to ring again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with an effort at brilliance</i>). The kitchen belle doesn't
seem to work.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Ordinarily she does, but she seems to be upset by something
this afternoon. I'm afraid she's in love. If you will excuse me a moment
I will go and prepare the tea myself.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Do; good! Then we shall not need the sugar.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> You might omit the spoons too, after a remark like that,
Miss Dorothy.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> We'll omit Mr. Barlow's spoon. I'll bring some for you and
me.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>She goes out.</i></p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a laugh</i>). That's one on you, Barlow. But I say, old
man (<i>taking out his watch and snapping the cover to three or four
times</i>), it's getting very late&mdash;after five now. If you want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> to go with
Billie Wilkins you'd better take up your hat and walk. I'll say good-bye
to Miss Andrews for you.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Thanks. Too late now. You said Billie wouldn't wait after
four-thirty.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Did I say four-thirty? I meant five-thirty. Anyhow, Billie
isn't over-prompt. Better go.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> You seem mighty anxious to get rid of me.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I? Not at all, my dear boy&mdash;not at all. I'm very, very fond
of you, but I thought you'd prefer opera to me. Don't you see? That's
where my modesty comes in. You're so fond of a good chat I thought you'd
want to go to-night. Wilkins has a box.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> You said seats a little while ago.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Of course I did. And why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> not? There are seats in boxes.
Didn't you know that?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Look here, Yardsley, what's up, anyhow? You've been deuced
queer to-day. What are you after?</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/fig_005.png" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">"WHAT'S UP, ANYHOW?"</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>tragically</i>). Shall I confide in you? Can I, with a sense
of confidence that you will not betray me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). Yes, Bob. Go on. What is it? I'll never give you
away, and I <i>may</i> be able to give you some good advice.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I am here to&mdash;to&mdash;to rob the house! Business has been bad,
and one must live.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>looks at him in disgust.</i></p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>mockingly</i>). You have my secret, John Barlow. Remember that
it was wrung from me in confidence. You must not betray me. Turn your
back while I surreptitiously remove the piano and the gas-fixtures,
won't you?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>looking at him thoughtfully</i>). Yardsley, I have done you an
injustice.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Indeed?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Yes. Some one claimed, at the club, the other day, that you
were the biggest donkey in existence, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> denied it. I was wrong, old
man, I was wrong, and I apologize. You are.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> You are too modest, Jack. You forget&mdash;yourself.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Well, perhaps I do; but I've nothing to conceal, and you have.
You've been behaving in a most incomprehensible fashion this afternoon,
as if you owned the house.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Well, what of it? Do you own it?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> No, I don't, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> But you hope to. Well, I have no such mercenary motive. I'm
not after the house.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>bristling up</i>). After the house? Mercenary motive? I demand
an explanation of those words. What do you mean?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I mean this, Jack Barlow: I mean that I am here for&mdash;for my
own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> reasons; but you&mdash;you have come here for the purpose of&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> No, no; nothing like that. It's&mdash;it's about Jennie.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>nervously</i>). Jennie? Wha&mdash;wha&mdash;what's the matter with
Jennie?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I only wish I knew. I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside</i>). I'm glad you don't.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> What say?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I didn't say anything. Why should I say anything? I haven't
anything to say. If people who had nothing to say would not insist upon
talking, you'd be&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I heard the poor girl weeping down-stairs, and when I went to
the dumb-waiter to ask her what was the matter, I heard&mdash;I heard a man's
voice.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Man's voice?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Man's voice is what Miss Andrews said.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Yes; it was Hicks, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> coachman, and he was dreadfully angry
about something.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>sinking into chair</i>). Good Lord! Hicks! Angry!
At&mdash;something!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> He was threatening to kill somebody.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> This grows worse and worse! Threatening to kill somebody!
D-did-did you o-over-overhear huh-huh-whom he was going to kuk-kill?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> What's the matter with you, Yardsley? Are you going to die of
fright, or have you suddenly caught a chill?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Oh, I hope not! Don't die here, anyhow, Mr. Yardsley. If you
must die, please go home and die. I couldn't stand another shock to-day.
Why, really, I was nearly frightened to death. I don't know now but
what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span> I ought to send for the police, Hicks was so violent.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Perhaps she and Hicks have had a lovers' quarrel.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Very likely; very likely, indeed. I think that is no doubt
the explanation of the whole trouble. Lovers will quarrel. They were
engaged, you know.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>surprised</i>). No, I didn't know it. Were they? Who told you?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>discovering his mistake</i>). Why&mdash;er&mdash;wasn't it you said so,
Miss Dorothy? Or you, Barlow?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I have not the honor of the young woman's confidence, and so
could not have given you the information.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I didn't know it, so how could I have told you?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Then I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> have dreamed it. I do have the
queerest dreams sometimes, but there's nothing strange about this one,
anyhow. Parlor-maids frequently do&mdash;er&mdash;become engaged to coachmen and
butlers and that sort of thing. It isn't a rare occurrence at all. If
I'd said she was engaged to Billie Wilkins, or to&mdash;to Barlow here&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Or to yourself.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Sir? What do you mean to insinuate? That I am engaged to
Jennie?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I never said so.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Oh, dear, let us have the tea. You quarrelsome men are just
wearing me out. Mr. Barlow, do you want cream in yours?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> If you please; and one lump of sugar. (<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>pours it
out</i>.) Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><i>Dorothy.</i> Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Just a little, Miss Andrews. No cream, and no sugar.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Dorothy</span> <i>prepares a cup for</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span>. <i>He is about to take it when</i>&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Well, I declare! <i>It's nothing but hot water! I forgot the
tea entirely!</i></p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>with a laugh</i>). Oh, never mind. Hot water is good for
dyspepsia.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>With a significant look at</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span>.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> It depends on how you get it, Mr. Barlow. I've known men

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Well, my cup is very satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> to me, Miss Dorothy. Fact

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Maybe the house is haunted.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I fancy it was your imagination; or perhaps it was the wind
blowing through the hall. The pantry window is open.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I guess maybe that's it. How fine it must be in the country
now!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Feathers, Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Feathers?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a furtive glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Jennie</span>). Ha, ha! What an absurd
slip! Did I say feathers? I meant&mdash;I meant leaves, of course. All the
leaves on the dusters are turning.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I don't believe you know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> what you do mean. Who ever heard of
leaves on dusters? What are dusters? Do you know, Miss Dorothy?</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>As he turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Andrews</span>, <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>tries to wave</i> <span class="smcap">Jennie</span>
<i>away. She beckons with her arms more wildly than ever, and</i>
<span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>silently speaks the words</i>, "Go away."</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I'm sure I don't know of any tree by that name, but then I'm
not a&mdash;not a what?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with a forced laugh</i>). Treeologist.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> What are dusters, Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Yes, old man, tell us. I'm anxious to find out myself.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside</i>). So am I. What the deuce are dusters, for this
occasion only? (<i>Aloud.</i>) What? Never heard of dust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>ers? Ho! Why, dear
me, where have you been all your lives? (<i>Aside.</i>) Must gain time to
think up what dusters are. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Why, they're as old as the hills.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> That may be, but I can't say I think your description is at
all definite.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Do they look like maples?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with an angry wave of his arms towards</i> <span class="smcap">Jennie</span>).
Something&mdash;in fact, very much. They're exactly like them. You can hardly
tell them from oaks.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Oaks?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I said oaks. Oaks! O-A-K-S!</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> But oaks aren't like maples.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Well, who said they were? We were talking about
oaks&mdash;and&mdash;er<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>and dusters. We&mdash;er&mdash;we used to have a row of them in
front of our old house at&mdash;(<i>Aside.</i>) Now where the deuce did we have
the old house? Never had one, but we must for the sake of the present
situation. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Up at&mdash;at&mdash;Bryn-Mawr&mdash;or at&mdash;Troy, or some such
place, and&mdash;at&mdash;they kept the&mdash;the dust of the highway from getting into
the house. (<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>) And so, you see, they were called
dusters. Thought every one knew that.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>finishes</i>, <span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>loses her balance and falls
headlong into the room</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>starting up hastily</i>). Why, Jennie!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>staggering into chair</i>). That settles it. It's all up with
me.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>sobs, and, rising, rushes to</i> <span class="smcap">Yardsley's</span> <i>side</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Jennie! What is the meaning of this? Mr. Yardsley&mdash;can&mdash;can
you shed any light on this mystery?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>pulling himself together with a great effort</i>). I? I assure
you I can't, Miss Andrews. How could I? All I know is that somebody
is&mdash;is going to kill me, though for what I haven't the slightest idea.</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> (<i>indignantly</i>). Eh? What? Why, Mr. Yardsley&mdash;Bob!</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Bob?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Jennie! Bob?</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/fig_006.png" alt="" /><p class="caption">"WHY, JENNIE!"</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><i>Yardsley.</i> Don't you call me Bob.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> It's Hicks.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<i>Bursts out crying.</i></p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Hicks?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Jennie, Hicks isn't Bob. His name is George.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>in a despairing rage</i>). Hicks be&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Mr. Yardsley!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>pulling himself together again</i>). Bobbed. Hicks be Bobbed.
That's what I was going to say.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> What on earth does this all mean? I must have an explanation,
Jennie. What have you to say for yourself?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Why, I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I tell you it isn't true. She's made it up out of whole
cloth.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> What isn't true? She hasn't said anything yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>desperately</i>). I refer to what she's going to say. I'm
a&mdash;a&mdash;I'm a mind-reader, and I see it all as plain as day.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I can best judge of the truth of Jennie's words when she has
spoken them, Mr. Yardsley. Jennie, you may explain, if you can. What do
you mean by Hicks killing Mr. Yardsley, and why do you presume to call
Mr. Yardsley by his first name?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>aside</i>). Heigho! My goose is cooked.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I fancy you wish you had taken that walk I suggested now.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> You always were a good deal of a fancier.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> I hardly knows how to begin, Miss Dorothy. I&mdash;I'm so
flabbergasted by all that's happened this afternoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span> mum, that I can't
get my thoughts straight, mum.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Never mind getting your thoughts straight, Jennie. I do not
want fiction. I want the truth.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Well, mum, when a fine gentleman like Mr. Yardsley asks&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I tell you it isn't so.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Indeed he did, mum.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>impatiently</i>). Did what?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Axed me to marry him, mum.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Mr. Yardsley&mdash;asked&mdash;you&mdash;to&mdash;to marry him?</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>whistles</i>.</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> (<i>bursting into tears again</i>). Yes, mum, he did, mum, right
here in this room. He got down on his knees to me on that Proossian rug
before the sofa, mum. I was standin' behind the sofa, havin' just come
in to tell him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> as how you'd be down shortly. He was standin' before the
lookin'-glass lookin' at himself, an' when I come in he turns around and
goes down on his knees and says such an importunity may not occur again,
mum; I've loved you very long; and then he recited some pottery, mum,
and said would I be his wife.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>desperately</i>). Let me explain.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Wait; Mr. Yardsley; your turn will come in a moment.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Yes, it'll be here, my boy; don't fret about that. Take all
the time you need to make it a good one. Gad! if this doesn't strain
your imagination, nothing will.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Go on, Jennie. Then what happened?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>with an injured expression</i>). Do you expect me to stand
here, Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> Andrews, and hear this girl's horrible story?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Then you know the story, do you, Yardsley? It's horrible, and
you are innocent. My! you are a mind-reader with a vengeance.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Don't mind what these gentlemen say, Jennie, but go on.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>sinks into the arm-chair</i>. <span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>chuckles</i>; <span class="smcap">Miss
Andrews</span> <i>glances indignantly at him</i>.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Pardon me, Mr. Barlow. If there is any humor in the
situation, I fail to see it.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>seeing his error</i>). Nor, indeed, do I. I was
not&mdash;ah&mdash;laughing from mirth. That chuckle was hysterics, Miss Dorothy,
I assure you. There are some laughs that can hardly be differentiated
from sobs.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> I was all took in a heap,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> mum, to think of a fine gentleman
like Mr. Yardsley proposing to me, mum, and I says the same. Says I,
"Oh, Mr. Yardsley, this is so suddent like," whereat he looks up with a
countenance so full o' pain that I hadn't the heart to refuse him; so,
fergettin' Hicks for the moment, I says, kind o' soft like, certingly,
sir. It ain't for the likes o' me to say no to the likes o' him.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Then you said you were engaged to Hicks. You know you did,
Jennie.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Ah! Then you admit the proposal?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Oh, Lord! Worse and worse! I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Jennie has not finished her story.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> I did say as how I was engaged to Hicks, but I thought he
would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> let me off; and Mr. Yardsley looked glad when I said that, and
said he'd make it all right with Hicks.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> What? I? Jennie O'Brien, or whatever your horrible name is,
do you mean to say that I said I'd make it all right with Hicks?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Not in them words, Mr. Yardsley; but you did say as how you'd
see him yourself and give him a present. You did indeed, Mr. Yardsley,
as you was a-standin' on that there Proossian rug.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Did you, Mr. Yardsley?</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Yardsley</span> <i>buries his face in his hands and groans</i>.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Not so ready with your explanations now, eh?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Mr. Barlow, really I must ask you not to interfere. Did you
say that, Mr. Yardsley?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I did, but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>frigidly</i>). Go on, Jennie.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Just then the front-door bell rings and Mr. Barlow comes, and
there wasn't no more importunity for me to speak; but when I got
down-stairs into the kitchen, mum, Mr. Hicks he comes in, an'
(<i>sobs</i>)&mdash;an' I breaks with him.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> You've broken with Hicks for me?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Yes, I have&mdash;but I wouldn't never have done it if I'd
known&mdash;boo-hoo&mdash;as how you'd behave this way an' deny ever havin' said a
word. I&mdash;I&mdash;I l-lo-love Mr. Hicks, an' I&mdash;I hate you&mdash;and I wish I'd let
him come up and kill you, as he said he would.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Jennie! Jennie! be calm! Where is Hicks now?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> That's so. Where is Hicks? I want to see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><i>Jennie.</i> Never fear for that. You'll see him. He's layin' for you
outside. An' that, Miss Dorothy, is why I was a-wavin' at him an' sayin'
"pst" to him. I wanted to warn him, mum, of his danger, mum, because
Hicks is very vi'lent, and he told me in so many words as how he was
a-goin' to <i>do&mdash;him&mdash;up</i>.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> You'd better inform Mr. Hicks, Jennie, that Mr. Yardsley is
already done up.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Do me up, eh? Well, I like that. I'm not afraid of any
coachman in creation as long as he's off the box. I'll go see him at
once.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> No&mdash;no&mdash;no. Don't, Mr. Yardsley; don't, I beg of you. I don't
want to have any scene between you.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>heroically</i>). What if he succeeds? I don't care. As Barlow
says, I'm done up as it is. I don't want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> to live after this. What's the
use. Everything's lost.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>dryly</i>). Jennie hasn't thrown you over yet.</p>

<p><i>Jennie</i> (<i>sniffing airily</i>). Yes, she has, too. I wouldn't marry him
now for all the world&mdash;an'&mdash;an' I've lost&mdash;lost Hicks. (<i>Weeps.</i>) Him as
was so brave, an' looks so fine in livery!</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> If you'd only give me a chance to say something&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Appears to me you've said too much already.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>coldly</i>). I&mdash;I don't agree with Mr. Barlow. You&mdash;you haven't
said enough, Mr. Yardsley. If you have any explanation to make, I'll
listen.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>looks up gratefully. Suddenly his face brightens. Aside</i>).
Gad! The very thing! I'll tell the exact truth, and if Dorothy has half
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> sense I think she has, I'll get in my proposal right under Barlow's
very nose. (<i>Aloud.</i>) My&mdash;my explanation, Miss Andrews, is very simple.
I&mdash;ah&mdash;I cannot deny having spoken every word that Jennie has charged to
my account. I did get down on my knees on the rug. I did say "divine
creature." I did not put it strong enough. I should have said "divinest
of <i>all</i> creatures."</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>in remonstrance</i>). Mr. Yardsley!</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>aside</i>). Magnificent bluff! But why? (<i>Rubs his forehead in a
puzzled way.</i>) What the deuce is he driving at?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Kindly let me finish. I did say "I love you." I should have
said "I adore you; I worship you." I did say, "Will you be my wife?" and
I was going to add, "for if you will not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> then is light turned into
darkness for me, and life, which your 'yes' will render radiantly
beautiful, will become dull, colorless, and not worth the living." That
is what I was going to say, Miss Andrews&mdash;Miss Dorothy&mdash;when&mdash;when
Jennie interrupted me and spoke the word I most wish to hear&mdash;spoke the
word "yes"; but it was not her yes that I wished. My words of love were
not for her.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>perceiving his drift</i>) Ho! Absurd! Nonsense! Most
unreasonable! You were calling the sofa the divinest of all creatures, I
suppose, or perhaps asking the&mdash;the piano to put on its shoes and&mdash;elope
with you. Preposterous!</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>softly</i>). Go on, Mr. Yardsley.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> I&mdash;I spoke a little while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> ago about sand&mdash;courage&mdash;when it
comes to one's asking the woman he loves the greatest of all questions.
I was boastful. I pretended that I had that courage; but&mdash;well, I am not
as brave as I seem. I had come, Miss Dorothy, to say to you the words
that fell on Jennie's ears, and&mdash;and I began to get
nervous&mdash;stage-fright, I suppose it was&mdash;and I was foolish enough to
rehearse what I had to say&mdash;to you, and to you alone.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Let me speak, Miss Andrews. I&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> You haven't anything to do with the subject in hand, my dear
Barlow, not a thing.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Jennie&mdash;what&mdash;what have you to say?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Me? Oh, mum, I hardly knows what to say! This is suddenter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
than the other; but, Miss Dorothy, I'd believe him, I would,
because&mdash;I&mdash;I think he's tellin' the truth, after all, for the reason
that&mdash;oh dear&mdash;for&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Don't be frightened, Jennie. For what reason?</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> Well, mum, for the reason that when I said "yes," mum, he
didn't act like all the other gentlemen I've said yes to, and&mdash;and
k-kuk-kiss me.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> That's it! that's it! Do you suppose that if I'd been after
Jennie's yes, and got it, I'd have let a door-bell and a sofa stand
between me and&mdash;the sealing of the proposal?</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>aside</i>). Oh, what nonsense this all is! I've got to get ahead
of this fellow in some way. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Well, where do I come in? I came
here, Miss Andrews, to tell you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>interposing</i>). You come in where you came in before&mdash;just a
little late&mdash;after the proposal, as it were.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>her face clearing and wreathing with smiles</i>). What a comedy
of errors it has all been! I&mdash;I believe you, Mr. Yardsley.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Thank Heaven! And&mdash;ah&mdash;you aren't going to say anything
more, D&mdash;Dorothy?</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/fig_007.png" alt="HICKS" /><p class="caption">HICKS</p></div>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> I'm afraid&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Are you going to make me go through that proposal all over
again, now that I've got myself into so much trouble saying it the first
time&mdash;Dorothy?</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> No, no. You needn't&mdash;you needn't speak of it again.</p>

<p><i>Barlow</i> (<i>aside</i>). Good! That's <i>his congé</i>.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> And&mdash;then if I&mdash;if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> needn't say it again? What then? Can't
I have&mdash;my answer now? Oh, Miss Andrews&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Dorothy</i> (<i>with downcast eyes, softly</i>). What did Jennie say?</p>

<p><i>Yardsley</i> (<i>in ecstasy</i>). Do you mean it?</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I fancy&mdash;I fancy I'd better go now, Miss&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Andrews.
I&mdash;I&mdash;have an appointment with Mr. Wilkins, and&mdash;er&mdash;I observe that it
is getting rather late.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Don't go yet, Jack. I'm not so anxious to be rid of you now.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I must go&mdash;really.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> But I want you to make me one promise before you go.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> He'll make it, I'm sure, if I ask him. Mr. Yardsley and I
want you&mdash;want you to be our best man.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> That's it, precisely. Eh, Jack?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><i>Barlow.</i> Well, yes. I'll be&mdash;second-best man. The events of the
afternoon have shown my capacity for that.</p>

<p><i>Yardsley.</i> Ah!</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> And I'll show my sincerity by wearing Bob's hat and coat into
the street now and letting the fury of Hicks fall upon me.</p>

<p><i>Jennie.</i> If you please, Miss Dorothy&mdash;I&mdash;I think I can attend to Mr.
Hicks.</p>

<p><i>Dorothy.</i> Very well. I think that would be better. You may go, Jennie.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[<span class="smcap">Jennie</span> <i>departs</i>.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> Well, good-day. I&mdash;I've had a very pleasant afternoon,
Miss&mdash;Andrews. Thanks for the&mdash;the cambric tea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><i>Dorothy.</i> Good-bye, and don't forget.</p>

<p><i>Barlow.</i> I'm afraid&mdash;I won't. Good-bye, Bob. I congratulate you from my
heart. I was in hopes that I should have the pleasure of having you for
a best man at <i>my</i> wedding, but&mdash;er&mdash;there's many a slip, you know, and
I wish you joy.</p>

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
